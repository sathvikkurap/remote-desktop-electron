# remote-desktop-electron
A remote desktop app that uses electron, robotjs, and socketio, among other frameworks. 
To use, open the project and in the command line type npm init. Don't allow it to overwrite package.json. When it's done, type npm i in the command line. To run, use npm start. This will start a server at http://your-ip-address.com:4009. Opening the server on another computer should give you remote desktop control.
